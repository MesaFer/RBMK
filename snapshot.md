## RBMK-1000 Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Thermal Power | 3200 MW | Nominal thermal power |
| Fuel Channels | 1661 | Number of fuel assemblies |
| Core Height | 7 m | Active core height |
| Core Diameter | 11.8 m | Core diameter |
| Control Rods | 211 | Total control rods |
| β_eff | 0.0065 | Effective delayed neutron fraction |
| Void Coefficient | +2×10⁻⁴ Δk/k/% | **Positive!** |

## Safety Notes

⚠️ **This is a simplified educational simulation.** Real RBMK reactors have:
- Much more complex neutronics (multi-group, 3D)
- Detailed thermal-hydraulics
- Multiple safety systems
- Extensive instrumentation

The positive void coefficient is accurately modeled - this was a key factor in the Chernobyl accident.

Code Snapshot Tool
==================

Usage: node snapshot.js <directory> [options]

Options:
  -o, --output <file>     Write output to file instead of stdout
  -e, --ext <extensions>  Filter by extensions (comma-separated, e.g., ".js,.ts")
  -i, --ignore <patterns> Additional ignore patterns (comma-separated)
  -f, --format <format>   Output format: markdown (default) or plain
  --include-empty         Include empty files
  --list                  Only list files, don't output content
  -h, --help              Show this help message

Examples:
  node snapshot.js ./src
  node snapshot.js ./src -o snapshot.md
  node snapshot.js ./src -e ".js,.ts" -o snapshot.md
  node snapshot.js . --ignore "test,spec" -o snapshot.md
